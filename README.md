# Domain-Specific Summarization with FLAN-T5 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project showcases a machine learning solution for domain-specific text summarization, specifically tailored to biology content. By fine-tuning the pre-trained FLAN-T5 model, the system generates concise and accurate summaries of complex biological texts, making it an effective tool for students, researchers, and educators.

# Key Features
- Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned the FLAN-T5 model on curated datasets containing long-form biology texts and their corresponding summaries.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured datasets to improve model performance by ensuring consistency and quality.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrated RAG to enhance summarization by retrieving contextually relevant information before generating summaries.
- Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance using ROUGE metrics, achieving scores of 45.23% (ROUGE-1) and 41.12% (ROUGE-L).

# Why This Project?
Generic summarization models often fail to perform well in specialized fields like biology. This project bridges the gap by leveraging advanced NLP techniques to create a tailored solution that balances precision and context.

# Technologies Used
- Hugging Face Transformers: For model fine-tuning and text generation.
- FAISS Indexing: For efficient context retrieval in the RAG pipeline.
- Python: For data preprocessing, model training, and integration.
This project demonstrates expertise in NLP, model fine-tuning, and retrieval-based AI systems, with a strong focus on practical applications in education and research.
